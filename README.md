# ⚛️ Bohr Atomic Model in C++ using Graphics

This project is a **graphical simulation** of the **Bohr Atomic Model** using **C++ and the graphics.h library**. It visually represents electrons revolving around a nucleus in fixed orbits, demonstrating atomic structure dynamically.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Graphical Representation** – Draws the nucleus and electron orbits using C++ graphics.  
✅ **Animated Electron Motion** – Electrons smoothly revolve around the nucleus.  
✅ **Multiple Energy Levels** – Supports up to three orbits with **2, 8, and 18 electrons**.  
✅ **Object-Oriented Design** – Uses classes for structured and efficient code.  
✅ **Realistic Motion** – Implements trigonometric calculations for smooth electron movement.  
✅ **Continuous Animation** – Electrons revolve indefinitely with adjustable speed.  

## 🖥️ Technologies Used  
- **C++**
- **graphics.h** (Borland/WinBGIm graphics library)
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**
- **Trigonometry for animation**

## 📌 Prerequisites  
Ensure you have a **C++ compiler** that supports `graphics.h`. You can use:  
🔹 **Dev-C++** with WinBGIm (Recommended)  
🔹 **Turbo C++**  
🔹 **CodeBlocks** (with graphics library setup)
